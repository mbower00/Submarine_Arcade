# Overview

## Purpose

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

## Networking

{Provide a description the networking program that you wrote. Describe how to use your software.  If you did Client/Server, then you will need to describe how to start both.}

## Game Framework

{Provide a description the game that you wrote. Describe how to play your game.}

## Demo

Here is a demonstration of the software.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (you will need to show two pieces of software running and communicating with each other) and a walkthrough of the code.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Network Communication

{Describe the architecture that you used (client/server or peer-to-peer)}

I used a peer to peer format for the networking side of this program

{Identify if you are using TCP or UDP and what port numbers are used.}

{Identify the format of messages being sent between the client and server or the messages sent between two peers.}

# Development Environment

## Tools

* *Visual Studio Code* - A code editor with extensions that I used
* *Aseprite* - A pixel art engine
* *Coolors* - A color palette generator 

## Language 

* *Python* - I used the Python programming language for this project. Python is a language that has many libraries which helped me in the development of this software.

## Libraries

* *arcade* - A game framework which has, among other things, the capability of pulling up a window with images that can move around.
* *socket* - A helpful library for providing a connection between two computers
* *threading* - A helpful library that I used to create a thread for a socket, so that it can be run apart from the main program. I used it to create a lock. 
* *json* - a helpful library for JSON and the conversion from a Python Dictionary to JSON.
* *random* - helpful for getting numbers
* *dataclasses* - Not sure if I am/need to be using this, but I pip installed it as part of an [Arcade tutorial](https://realpython.com/arcade-python-game-framework/)
* *PyObjC arcade* - Not sure if I am/need to be using this, but I pip installed it as part of an [Arcade tutorial](https://realpython.com/arcade-python-game-framework/)
